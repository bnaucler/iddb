# iddb v0.2A
An identity database to manage your contacts.  

## Written by
Björn Westerberg Nauclér (mail@bnaucler.se) 2017

Compiled and tested on Arch Linux 4.8.

## Why iddb?
iddb is written to be lightweight, portable, lightning fast and requiring minimal storage space.

This might be useful in embedded applications or legacy systems.  
However; for most applications you'll find [abook](http://abook.sourceforge.net/) or [khard](https://github.com/scheibler/khard) much more useful.

## Dependencies
* SQLite3

## Usage
`make`  
`./iddb help`  
Should get you started.
